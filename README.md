# Choices_Game

A thrilling choose your own adventure game called: "Sick or Swim"

A "choose your own adventure" game is a type of interactive fiction where the player is presented with a series of choices throughout the story, and the outcome of the story is determined by the choices the player makes. It is also known as a branching narrative and is a game with the player making decisions and controlling the story by turning to different screens in the game. Each choice the user makes will impact the outcome of the story. This project will include a storyline, graphic elements, and conditionals to control flow. We’ll be using pygame (module in python) to display an aesthetically pleasing and interactive website with a strong UX design. It will be kind of like a simulator as well, with more graphics.

Picture this: you are sitting at home, alone, bored. There is a pandemic sweeping across the nation and you are feeling sad. What do you turn to? Video games. Hmm…I wish there was a game like maze runner but on a ship to spice things up. You guessed it, you would play Sick or Swim! For those of you that don’t know what maze runner is, one person has the disease and is slowly going insane. You have to find who the person is before everybody on the ship dies. Mixed with anticipation, excitement, and skill, Sick or Swim is the right game for you.

The best part is it’s a choose your own adventure game where you make the decisions and control the game! Every choice you make could be the difference between life and death…and remember it’s never the same!

This game is structured in the forms of day…do you think you have what it takes to survive 5 days on this ship? You have to utilize your money well, make the right decisions, play minigames, and even do escape rooms! Each day has something special in store for you! This is the best game, by far. It cures your boredom, brings some entertainment in your life, and will keep you thrilled for days! The best part is…you can play this game over and over again, each run through of the game is different since YOU choose the plot! This game is intended for people of all ages.
